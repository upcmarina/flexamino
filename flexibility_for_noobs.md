**WE ARE CALCULATING FLEXIBILITY, BUT WHAT IS FLEXIBILITY?**
=========================================

The term "flexibility" in context with protein structures is used with a variety of meanings. For instance, both a protein molecule in random coil conformation and a molecule occurring as two different stable,
but interconvertible conformers are named flexible. A precise definition of flexibility in a particular system requires determination of the number and geometry of the various conformers, their stability, the energy barriers separating the conformers, the kinetic parameters
of interconversion and the thermal motion of the atoms within each conformer

Proteins are dynamic entities, and they possess an inherent flexibility that allows them to function through molecular interactions within the cell, among cells and even between organisms.
Protein flexibility, it is clear that it is encoded within their amino acid sequence and should be viewed as an integral part of their structure
