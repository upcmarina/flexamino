**PROJECT INFORMATION**
===================================

Send composition of gropups

GOAL: Development of flexibility score for proteins

Flex score for each aa in seq

* Parseable text output
* Graphical

Indep evaluation for PYT and SBI. Theoretical part --> Baldo

Develop pipeline/ workflow, don't import  a library that calculates the flex scores. Use libraries like biopython, but not packages for flexibility.

To read MSA we can use libraries for that.

Program structure! very important, file for classes, DIVIDE CODE IN MODULES!! 

Proposed steps:  (diapo)

* Work with MSA

by analyzing this alignments develop a flex score and then represent results --> we'll see libraries for this scores

Date for project --> near exam day
