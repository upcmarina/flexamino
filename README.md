# ABOUT

**FlexAmino** is a Python program 
based on the search of homologs for a given protein sequence. Crystallographic beta-factors are extracted from the homologs that have an available known structure and with them, a beta-factor profile is generated and assigned to the query sequence using a structural alignment.

# INSTALLATION

First of all, clone the current repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/upcmarina/structural_biology.git
```

Before running **FlexAmino**, you need to install some dependencies. This step can be done by hand or in an automatized way typing the following commands (in cmd):
```
sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools

sudo python3 setup.py install
```
