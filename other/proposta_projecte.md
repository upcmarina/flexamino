**PROPOSTA PROJECTE**
=======================

Train model with x sequences of the family of the input sequence to evaluate. We want to have profile of structural alphabets / bfactors. Once we have this general profile, we apply to the input sequence to evaluate.

Do profiles for the general families + provide the function to the user if he wants to evaluate a new family not available in the previous set.
