**WE ARE CALCULATING FLEXIBILITY, BUT WHAT IS FLEXIBILITY?**
=========================================

* What flexibility means?

The term "flexibility" in context with protein structures is used with a variety of meanings. For instance, both a protein molecule in random coil conformation and a molecule occurring as two different stable, but interconvertible conformers are named flexible. A precise definition of flexibility in a particular system requires determination of the number and geometry of the various conformers, their stability, the energy barriers separating the conformers, the kinetic parameters
of interconversion and the thermal motion of the atoms within each conformer

* Which amino acid provides highest flexibility in the protein structure?

Accordingly, the most flexible amino acids, including Gly, Ser, Asn, and Asp, are β-turn-forming amino acids, while the most rigid amino acids, namely Val and Ile, are β-sheet-forming amino acids.

* Why is flexibility important in proteins?

Proteins are dynamic entities, and they possess an inherent flexibility that allows them to function through molecular interactions within the cell, among cells and even between organisms.

Flexibility is of overwhelming importance for protein function, and the changes in protein structure during interactions with binding partners can be dramatic

While much remains to be understood about protein flexibility, it is clear that it is encoded within their amino acid sequence and should be viewed as an integral part of their structure.

* Structural Alphabets (SA):

Proteins are often considered as rigid macromolecules while their structures exhibit specific flexibility, which is essential to complete their functions. Analyses of protein structures and dynamics are often performed with a simplified three-state description, i.e., the classical secondary structures. More precise and complete description of protein backbone conformation can be obtained using libraries of small protein fragments that are able to approximate every part of protein structures. These libraries, called structural alphabets (SAs), have been widely used in structure analysis field, from definition of ligand binding sites to superimposition of protein structures. SAs are also well suited to analyze the dynamics of protein structures. 

SAs have been used at three different levels to comprehend protein flexibility: (i) for studying specific fundamental biological and biomedical problems, (ii) to analyze changes associated with protein complexation and allostery, and (iii) to predict protein flexibility.

The backbone conformational variations can be described as changes in the pattern of SAs, which acts as fingerprints of the dynamics involved.

* About B-factors:

Most of the prediction methods use the crystallographic data (namely B-factors) as the only indicator of protein’s inner flexibility and predicts them as rigid or flexible.

The atomic mean-square displacement, or B-factor, measured during crystallographic experiments reflects an uncertainty about the position of atoms and represents the combined effects of the thermal vibrations and the static disorder. However, B-factor is not an absolute quantification of flexibility: it depends on the resolution of the structure, on the refinement procedure, on contacts in the crystal or on the structural environment. Flexibility is also indirectly highlighted by NMR experiments that show, in some circumstances, different local conformations that could correspond to different states of protein structures. The distinction between flexible, highly flexible and unstructured or disordered regions remains a difficult task.

# CALCULATING PROTEIN FLEXIBILITY

* B-factors: B- or temperature factors produced by X-ray crystallography to elucidate flexibilities of proteins. The B-factor reflects the degree of thermal motion and static disorder of an atom in a protein crystal structure. However, there is noise in experimentally determinate B-factor. Many factors can affect the value of B-factor such as the overall resolution of the structure, crystal contacts, and, importantly, the particular refinement procedures. B-values from different structures can therefore not be reasonably compared. Some researchers considered that the upper limit of accuracy for the prediction of B-factors is no more than 80% .
